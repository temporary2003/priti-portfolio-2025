# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue
The React Vite app was failing to deploy on Vercel with the error:
```
SyntaxError: Named export 'renderToReadableStream' not found. 
The requested module 'react-dom/server' is a CommonJS module
```

## Root Cause
The import pattern for `react-dom/server` was causing CommonJS/ESM compatibility issues in Vercel's Node.js runtime environment.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `app/entry.server.jsx`
Changed the import from:
```javascript
import { renderToPipeableStream } from "react-dom/server";
```
To:
```javascript
import * as ReactDOMServer from "react-dom/server";
const { renderToPipeableStream } = ReactDOMServer;
```

### 2. Updated `vite.config.js`
Added SSR configuration for better CommonJS/ESM compatibility:
```javascript
ssr: {
  external: ['react-dom/server'],
  noExternal: ['react', 'react-dom']
},
```

### 3. Updated `package.json`
Changed Node.js engine specification to use Node 18.x for better Vercel compatibility:
```json
"engines": {
  "node": "18.x"
}
```

## Verification
- ✅ Local build completed successfully: `npm run build`
- ✅ No errors in server build
- ✅ All assets generated correctly
- ✅ Server bundle uses ESM format as intended

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Resolve react-dom/server import compatibility for Vercel deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Vercel will automatically detect the push and redeploy
   - Or manually redeploy from the Vercel dashboard

3. **Verify the deployment:**
   - Check that the site loads without 500 errors
   - Test all routes work correctly

## Technical Details
- Uses `import * as ReactDOMServer` pattern for better CommonJS/ESM compatibility
- Maintains Node.js platform targeting for Vercel
- Uses ESM server module format with proper externalization
- Compatible with Node.js 18.x runtime on Vercel
