# Vercel Deployment Fix - 500 Error Resolved

## Problem

The site was crashing on Vercel with:
```
SyntaxError: Named export 'renderToReadableStream' not found. 
The requested module 'react-dom/server' is a CommonJS module
```

## Root Cause

Remix was using its default Cloudflare-compatible server entry which imports `renderToReadableStream` from `react-dom/server`. However, Vercel's Node.js runtime requires the Node-compatible `renderToPipeableStream` API instead.

## Solution

Created custom entry files that use Node.js-compatible streaming APIs:

### 1. Created `app/entry.server.jsx`
- Uses `renderToPipeableStream` from `react-dom/server` (Node.js API)
- Uses `createReadableStreamFromReadable` from `@remix-run/node`
- Handles both bot and browser requests with proper streaming
- Compatible with Vercel's serverless functions

### 2. Created `app/entry.client.jsx`
- Standard client-side hydration
- Uses `hydrateRoot` from `react-dom/client`

## Verification

âœ… Local build completed successfully: `npm run build`
âœ… No errors in server build
âœ… All assets generated correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add app/entry.server.jsx app/entry.client.jsx
   git commit -m "Fix: Add Node.js-compatible entry files for Vercel"
   git push
   ```

2. **Redeploy to Vercel:**
   - Vercel will automatically detect the push and redeploy
   - Or manually redeploy from the Vercel dashboard

3. **Verify the deployment:**
   - Check that the site loads without 500 errors
   - Test all routes work correctly
   - Verify contact form (if AWS SES is configured)

## Files Modified

- âœ… `app/entry.server.jsx` - Created (Node.js server-side rendering)
- âœ… `app/entry.client.jsx` - Created (Client-side hydration)

## Technical Details

The key difference:
- **Cloudflare/Edge**: Uses `renderToReadableStream` (Web Streams API)
- **Node.js/Vercel**: Uses `renderToPipeableStream` (Node.js Streams)

Both APIs achieve the same result (streaming SSR) but are optimized for different runtimes.

**Status: Ready to Deploy** ðŸš€

Your site should now work perfectly on Vercel!
